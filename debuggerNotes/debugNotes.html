<div class="txtbox2">
    <span class="hilite1">Console API</span>
    <div class="innerbox3">Breakpoints
    Breakpoints remain on reload of the page.
    I could even edit my code and the breakpoint will move
    (or 'follow') the line down the page and remain attached
    to that executable line.</div>
    You can even set breakpoints in your code with...<div class="innerbox2"><code>debugger;</code></div>
    <div class="hilite1 squatbox bldk"><h4 class="ctr redlite">Breakpoint Variations</h4><ul>
    <li>Conditional</li>
    <li>Hardcoded</li>
    <li>DOM (in elements tab)</li>
    <li>XHR (for ajax)</li>
    <li>Event Listener</li>
</div>
    For instance you can have a <span class="gr">Conditional Breakpoint</span>:
    Right now, in the debugger: rt-click and edit a B-point
    <div class="innerbox2">console.log("this is the");<span class="reddrk b">  c > a </span></div>
    Because c > a is false, it wont stop.

    Next, @ log line, edit a TRUE condition:<div class="innerbox2">console.log("end of the program");<span class="reddrk b">  a > c </span>
    Because a is greater than c it will stop<br>and not execute it's line.</div>
    This is also achieved with:<div class="compact">if (a > c) {   // true
    debugger;
}</div>
    <h4 class="hilite1">Listener events like
    click events--wont "break" any time there's a click--
    They will 'activate' any time .js is triggered by a mouseclick.
    <h3>Pause on exceptions</h3>
    Often, .js can 'fail silently' and produce errors but NOT BREAK THE CODE
    entirely. This can also happen with hard-coded "try-catch" exception handling.
    there is a pause button to the right in the debugger.

    <span class="redlite">"Pause on Exceptions".</span>
    Click this button to alert you to "quiet errors" in your code.

        pause | stepover | into | outof | disable  | Exceptions
        <img id="stepping" src="stepping.png" alt="stepping" />
        Step Over --> Steps to next executable line.
        Step into --> inside the function call.
        Step out --> executes everything it needs to in order to
            get out of whatever function call you're in.

    rt-click "continue to here" is like a quasi-breakpoint

    clicking the "{}" @ bottom of debugger does a pretty-print
    (if you were lost in a rabbit hole of a minified file)

</div>

<div class="txtbox3"><h4 class="ctr lemon">ch 2.6 CALLSTACK</h4>
        list of <i>fn</i> that have been called to get you to where you are.
    <img src="callstack.png" alt="callstack" />

    Step Over --> Steps to next executable line.
    Step into --> inside the function call.
    Step out --> executes everything it needs to in order to
            get out of whatever function call you're in.

    <span class="wh">Option Click the arrow beside folder in sources panel.
    Automagically view everything!</span>

        <img id="opt" src="optclick.png" alt="optclick" />
    </div>
    Renaming anon-fns is really helpful to orient your self in the callstack.

    Every time you step into a <i>fn</i> it is added to the top
    of the callstack.

    You can click each Callback in the panel.
    They each are referred to as a "frame".

    As you click you can check the values of your local variables in each "frame".

<div class="txtbox2">
    Ch2.7 Watches
    Any expression is possible.
    These are OFTEN used to monitor variables that may change.

    You can also modify any variable in code for example
    <span class="wh">someArray.pop();</span>
    as a watch expression.
