<h1>Questions For Preston</h1>



Question For Preston:

1. Why build Angular with the need for ng-cloak? That is, why wasn't it hardcoded into the api to begin with?
Is there any use case for NOT using it on a production site?

2.
What is the propertyIsEnumerable use case where it returns false?

Does it simply check whether it belongs to an obj? or is it qualitatively different from hasOwnProperty?

what does it mean to say that in js functions are first class?

3.
--- .sort() with a "comparison function":

I can go thru this in devtools debugger and watch the the values of A & B get changed.

var nums = [3, 20, 1000];
nums.sort(function(a, b) {
    if (a < b) {
        return -1;
    } else if (a === b){
        return 0;
    } else {
        return 1;
    }
});
console.log(nums);

My question is: How does it change the order of the Array?
(No counter or 'placeholder' var is used to store results exists!)
--Should I just resolve to trust that V8 is working it's magic and move on with my life? :)
-------

Here are some random questions that I've been wrestling with & that I've had a hard time getting info about.

Browser Paint question
If a square 'rendered' with css or .js (whose x and y coords offset it outside of the viewport) & it is animating... is there processing occuring underneath the hood?

How about if it is obscured behind another shape (or image) with a higher z-index and-in fact-does not "paint" to the page?

Let's say it is animating... Does the browser engine process calculations as though it were?

Should car be capitalized?
----
var car = {
    engine: "V8",
    topSpeed: "195mph",
    mpg: 34,
    getFacts: function() {
        var report = this.engine + " : "+ this.topSpeed + " : " + this.mpg;
        return report;
    }
};
car.getFacts();

---- "or is capitalization only used in function declarations (and future calls to) Constructor functions?"



Q 4 Preston:

function Car(engine, topSpeed, mpg, nickName) {
    this.engine = engine;
    this.topSpeed = topSpeed;
    this.mpg = mpg;
    this.nickName = nickName;

    this.getFacts = function() {
    return this.engine + " : "+ this.topSpeed + " : " + this.mpg;
    };
    this.greet = function(nickName) {
        alert("Hi, " + this.nickName + "! I'm " + nickName);
    }
}
var hisCar = new Car("v6", "200", 35, "Rusty");
var herCar = new Car("v8", "120", 30, "Slick");

console.log(hisCar.greet(herCar));

// How would you get one car to "greet" another car and self-introduce?
// this.greet = function(nickName) {
//     alert("Hi, " + this.nickName + "! I'm " + nickName);
// }
// This gives me "Hi, Rusty! I'm [object Object]"

Q 4 Preston

which is more performant?

In JavaScript:

object.onclick=function(){myScript};

In JavaScript, using the addEventListener() method:

object.addEventListener("click", myScript);

---

Q 4 Preston:

Do you have a link to simply describe pass by value vs pass by reference?
--this example is from from Lynda "practical & effective js"--

"Primitive Values are passed to FNs as a distinct copy of themselves. Changing them has no effect"
function f(x) {
    x += 5; // no effect
}

function h () {
    var x = 5;
    f(x); // x is still 5
}
----------
Composite Objects are passed by reference.
("changing their contents inside a FN, that change
Does have an effect")

function f (obj) {
    //this has an effect
    obj.d = new Date(2009, 12);
}
function h () {
    var x = new Object();
    x.d = new Date();
    f(x); // x.d has changed
}

-------------



Q 4 Preston:

If <i>this</i> is inside of a function that is part of an object...

var car = {
    color: "red",
    sound: function() {
        this.horn = "honk!";
        return this.horn;
    }
}

console.log(car.color);
console.log(car.sound());


Then, this points to the object itself.

HOWEVER...

if this is inside of a constructor function...

function Person(name) {
this.name = name;
}
var bob = new Person("Bob");

document.write(bob.name); // Bob

This points to the the instance created by the function


Question I. Is the above sentence correct?
        II. Is the car object properly constructed? --if so
        III. Is it absolutely necessary for me to have to have the line "return this.horn;" in order to access
        the string "honk!"? --is there another way?


Q 4 Preston:

What is the difference? --I seem to be getting 5 immediately:

setTimeout(alert("Five"), 5000);
setTimeout(function(){ alert("Seven"); }, 7000);



-----------------

Timers question #2: Any way of doing this by hiding the global var?

'use strict';
// var counter = 0;
function heartBeat() {
    // var counter;
    console.log("thump, thump");

    counter+= 1;
    if (counter === 10) {
        clearInterval(interval);
    }

}

var interval = setInterval(heartBeat, 2000);
var counter = 0;



Question: Setting aside issues of best practice (which prefer string literals to constructors)...How to operate on myObjString so as to render

myObjString = { 1: "H",
            2: "u",
            3: "l",
            4: "l",
            5: "o"
        };
---------




    Only the .data() API reads HTML5 data-* attributes, and it does so once.
The in-memory data object for an element is initialized from those data-* attributes the first time you call .data() for the element. Any subsequent changes to the attributes are ignored, since jQuery has already cached the data.

Rule: If HTML5 data-* attributes change during program execution, use jQuery's .attr() method to get the current values.

1. rgba() affects a single property, like color, background-color or border-color, of elements targeted by CSS and only of these elements.
2. Opacity affects all properties (the whole outlook) of targeted elements along with all their DOM tree children.


The difference between window.load()
and $(document).ready(function() {
    })
and
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {

})
and
(function($) {

    })(jQuery);

stopPropagation(): For something like this, it's too abstract 4 me. I need to see
what propagation is, before I can understand and recognize the motivation for creating this in the api in the first place. --No one teaches that.

Is there a way to view in the chrome devtools, the keys and values set by jq's data() method?

How many files does a browser d/l from a single domain?
Is there a limit?

Difference between $scope and .this

What is an object instance property.

NB: The value of '.this' depends on the object used
to call that method.

What does that really mean?
--Can you give me an example of this statement?



What does it mean to say that js has first level functions?

plsight js fund jq adv DOM vid 2.5 summary
is using a bad example. ("Why bad?")

Why design js with both call() and apply()?
why not just use apply(~~,["arg"])
--It seems like it's wet code?



in AJAX readystate ===4 is good. but what does 1, 2, 3 mean? --just curious--

<code><pre>

-----------
var me = {
    name: {
        first: "Tom"
    }
  },
  name = me.name;

name = {
    first: "Jerry"
};
me.name.first;

[proto chain -> "__proto__ chain"].


What is the difference between a proto chain and a prototype chain?

</pre></code>

window.name is a property which is almost certainly being type-coerced to
a string. Therefore you get [object Object].

"We should change this slide".

name is "a special variable" essentially in the global context.

If we did this in node.js, this wouldn't happened.

Running it in a browser, we're at the mercy of the env. we're running it in.
