Side Project CV Progress

Every Skill is represented by a seed, a sapling, and eventually a plant.

Each is linked to a single twitter feed called @DevBotany

App reads key words like CSS, GSAP, HTML, etc...

The feed is read by the app and displays latest tweets.

The Tweets--according to what topic the tweet is increment a counter

This counter triggers a water-can that pours over the plant and turns the ground darker brown.

As time goes by, the ground dries up and the leaves begin to brown, if neglected... This triggers a brown color in the plants.

after weeks go by, the sapling grows to a plant, and eventually buds appear and begin to bloom into the logos of the particular technology.


They,too, may begin to brown as time passes and if neglected.
